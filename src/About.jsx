    <h2>Our Story – JanBroz</h2>
    <p>
      We come from the breathtaking valleys of Hunza, where the mountains rise like poetry and culture lives in every melody. In our childhood, dance wasn't something we were taught — it was something we felt. In the heart of our village gatherings, all eyes would turn to one man: our grandfather — a graceful, spirited folk dancer. His movements weren’t just steps; they were stories. Watching him perform lit a quiet fire in both of us.

      Growing up, the rhythm of Hunza Hareep, the soul of Tajik and Shina music, and the emotion of Burushaski lyrics shaped our world. We began dancing at local events just for the joy of it — syncing our moves, laughing, learning, and slowly realizing that this was more than a hobby. It was a language we were learning — and we were fluent without ever going to a dance school.

      As twin brothers, we found rhythm not just in music, but in each other. We trained ourselves — listening to songs late at night, mimicking moves we saw, then making them our own. We fused folk with freestyle, tradition with K-pop, and raw emotion with modern choreography. This is how JanBroz was born — two dancers, one rhythm, and a shared vision.

      But it was Jubilee Arts 2018 in Lisbon that truly changed everything. Standing on that international stage, representing Pakistan, we felt something shift. That performance wasn't just a milestone — it was a message. We realized we could blend who we are with who we want to become. We could carry our cultural roots into new styles, new spaces, and new stories — all through dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, every performance we create is more than choreography. It’s a reflection of where we come from, what we carry, and how we hope to connect. Dance, for us, is memory, identity, and innovation — moving as one, moving with purpose.
